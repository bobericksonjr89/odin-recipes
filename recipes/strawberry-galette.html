    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An amazing summer treat and a crowd pleaser, strawberry gelettes are easy
      to make and worth the bit of hassle of preparing a homemade pastry and
      whipped cream. I use strawberries from my garden, sometimes frozen and
      vaccumed sealed as the season for good strawberries is quite short.

        Cut 5-8 incisions into the exposed pastry all around the mixture, evenly
