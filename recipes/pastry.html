    <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
    <p>
      A shortcrust pastry is an essential recipe for pie baking. Butter is cut
      and smeared into a flour mixture, resulting in a tender and flakey crust.
      It is essential to keep the pastry cold while you are working it or else
      the butter will melt. The idea is to have chunks of butter in the finished
      dough which will give the pastry its flakey character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of water used to hydrate the dough will vary depending on
      ambient humidity. You should increase the amount of water used in the
      winter months when the flour in the pantry will be dryer. Knowing how much
      extra water to add comes with experience.

    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks) chilled butter, cut into small chunks</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chilled shortening, cut into small chunks</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk together flour and salt for 20 seconds.</li>
      <li>
        Add 1 stick of butter and all the shortening to the flour mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the butter and shortening into the flour with a pastry cutter or
        your fingers until the mixture resembles crumbly cornmeal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining butter and cut into the mixture until you get pea
        sizes clumps of butter and flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add water tablespoon by tablespoon, mixed in with a fork, just until the
        dough comes together when shaped into a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into two equal sizes balls, flatten into fat disks, wrap
        with plastic, and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours.
