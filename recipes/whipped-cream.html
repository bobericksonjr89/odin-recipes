    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Homemade whipped cream is incomparable to the store bought and so simple
      to make. All you need is some heavy cream and sugar, and optionally
      vanilla extract to flavor. Most people likely use their stand mixer but I
      like to whip mine by hand. Vary the amount of sugar based on your
      preferences.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2-5 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine cream and sugar in a mixing bowl, and chill in the fridge for
        5-10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        When chilled, beat rapidy with a whisky until cream froths, expands, and
        forms stiff peaks. Be sure to stop and not over beat.
      </li>
      <li>Add optional vanilla.</li>
    </ol>
